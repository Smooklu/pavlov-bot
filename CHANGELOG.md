# Changelog

## v0.7.1 - 2021-01-15
- Autobalance: Designed primarly for PUSH servers, this feature monitors the scoreboard for team killers and kicks or bans at your tolerance limit. Watches player count for the two teams and when enough players are present and the teams are unbalanced, forces players from high count team to low to keep games numerically balanced.

## v0.6.1 - 2020-11-?
- Improved performance of `;players` command
